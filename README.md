# GameLauncher
A simple launcher that takes in a path to the game and command line argument should you have any plus an option to keep the window open for whatever reason. 

Can be used for just about anything due to its simplicity, I made this just to see how launchers work. I will probably do an installer next because I have always wondered how they work.
